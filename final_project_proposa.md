## FINAL PROJECT GUIDELINES

### DUE DATE: AT ANY POINT BEFORE MAY 23, earlier proposals are ENCOURAGED.

### The Project can be any or multiples of

- A new thing of your choosing made from scratch
- Extension of another weekly (or previous) project into larger comprehensive work
- A secret third thing
- Extension/remix of something 'out there in the world'
- A collaboration with another student (you turn in documentation separately).

### The Project should

- Be primarily code that you write “from scratch”. It's okay to use existing tools and libraries that you connect together in some way.
- Have some conceptual basis. The project will be technical, but doesn’t need to be “about technology” (work about technology, whether critical or analytical, is valid, but only one of many approaches).
- Involve you documenting your process as you work in some way.
- Include a brief bibliography/mediagraphy of media (including software, images, sound, and so on) that inspired your project, or are referenced or incorporated into it. I
  - Ai policy here

### Constraints

You should avoid **_generic_** portfolio sites, conventional games (fitting within obvious genres), and the like. Feel free to make something that looks like one of these but has something else going on; re-appropriating well-worn formats is a valid approach.

If you want to make things more interesting, find a constraint to apply to your work. Some examples:

- only work with 20x20 pixel images.
- Make a complex dynamic image with only 2 _for_ loops (or equivalent).
- For an audio project, limit audio buffers to to 500ms.
- Or to make things even more interesting, ask a classmate for a constraint! (you can always veto)

### The Off-Ramp

Starting the week your project has been approved, you MAY turn in weekly updates on your project in lieu of other weekly assignments. A weekly update can be a working prototype or 200-300 words that answer: What progress did you make? What trouble did you find? How did you work to solve these problems (even if you haven’t solved them yet)?

If you want to keep doing the weekly assignments post-proposal, that's okay, too! I give the off-ramp option to allow you to focus your learning on the needs of your project in case that doesn't line up with the modules I've planned.

Attendance is still mandatory.

## THE PROPOSAL

### WHAT TO INCLUDE

- What you're going to make, what format it will be in and how it will be shown to the class and/or published.
- To the extent possible, break the project into steps. How long do you think each step will take; what do you need to learn/figure out to complete this step?
- Tools and methodologies you intend to use (you don't need to know all of these in advance). For the primary technology involved, what resources can you turn to for help? What communities exist for the tool/project??
- How will you be documenting your process? Git commit messages? A handwritten diary? screenshots with journal entries? And so on…
- What's this about? What's the concept behind it? What other work or ideas does it reference? What other makers or specific works do you see this as being in conversation with?
- If sketches/diagrams/prototypes help communicate the project better than typing out a description, feel free to include and refer to them.

A successful proposal will answer **_most_** of the questions above. I don’t expect you to have figured all of this out before you start. Answer as many as you can, and keep these questions in mind as you work; they are also guidance for your documentation process.

Any questions? Ideas you're not sure about? Maybe a project that's bigger than one person and you're looking for collaborators? Ask in this thread.

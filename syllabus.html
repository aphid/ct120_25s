<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION</h4>
<p>Attendance will be taken at class meetings. Your presence is expected and required. Coding is very often done in isolation. One of the benefits of this class is the experience of sharing and engaging with each other's work, collaborating on projects (optionally), and helping each other when we end up out in the weeds with a technical or conceptual problem. Participation can also happen in the class chatroom (on matrix) during or outside of set course times.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>WEEKLY PROJECTS</h4>
<p>Weekly prompts will be given for projects that require practicing technical and conceptual skills needed to complete this course. Some will take longer than others.</p>
<h4>FINAL PROJECT</h4>
<p>At any point in the course, you may propose a final project relevant to course concepts and techniques. It can be an extension of a weekly project or something you started in another course. Further details will be provided</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION</strong></h3>
<p><span>Project-driven practicum in arts and design applications of computer languages. Students will apply new coding approaches in ongoing individual and collaborative projects, including those set in motion in prior Creative Technologies courses. Students learn to code "<strong>from scratch</strong>", rather than through the modification of prototype examples. Explore how programming languages function not only as tools but as institutional frameworks, sometimes invisibly shaping social norms and contemporary art and design practices; learn conscientious uses of code that can contribute to accessible technology and the empowerment of audiences, users, and media consumers. </span></p>
<h3><strong>LEARNING OUTCOMES</strong></h3>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>COURSE</strong></span></h4>
<p><span>Completion of this course will entail several abilities and competencies. Among them are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> Generate original code for visual, aural, and textual expression in a variety of contexts.</span></li>
<li><span> Develop strategies for real-time engagement with sound-processing and image-processing software.</span></li>
<li><span> Gain competency (and the means to develop proficiency) in 1-2 commonly operated computer languages.</span></li>
<li><span> Gain confidence in a variety of multimedia applications for code, and combinations of coded and visual-interface media production tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><em><strong><br /></strong></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PROGRAM</strong></span></h4>
<h4><strong>Digital Literacy</strong><span> <br /></span></h4>
<p><span>Gain literacy in creative tools for digital expression, and in the effective use of technology in arts and design: including digital platforms and algorithms, AI- and algorithmic arts and design tools, and emerging technology in a variety of media.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Strategies for Creative Practice</strong><span> <br /></span></h4>
<p><span>Learn strategies for bringing complex work to completion, individually and collaboratively, across a variety of media, including written, image- and sound-based, performance-based, and socially engaged media.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Cultivation of Collaborative Growth</strong><span> <br /></span></h4>
<p><span>Cultivate a mindset of curiosity, dialogue, and growth, with respect to one&rsquo;s work and process, and its social and ethical impact. We learn from mistakes as well as triumphs&mdash;ours and others&rsquo;&mdash;as we work toward meaningful creative work and social change.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Course Materials</span></h2>
<p><span>You will need access to a computer, a text editor or IDE (we'll discuss these in class), curiosity, and persistence. You can complete all the assignments using free software. üêß<br /></span></p>

<h2><span>Course Schedule</span></h2>
<p><i><span>The land on which we gather is the unceded territory of the Awaswas-speaking Uypi Tribe. The Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, comprised of the descendants of indigenous people taken to missions Santa Cruz and San Juan Bautista during Spanish colonization of the Central Coast, is today working hard to restore traditional stewardship practices on these lands and heal from historical trauma.</span></i></p>
<p><strong>The following schedule offers approximations of course activities spanning the quarter. Circumstances may lead to modifications of these activities, and changes in their order or time-line.&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Week 1: </span><strong>Getting Situated, Environments, Version Control</strong></h4>
<p><span>Questions: Where are we at? What do we know? What do we want to know? What do we need to know? What do we know we don&rsquo;t know? How do we collaborate? How do we give and receive feedback?&nbsp; How do we work? What do our development environments look like?&nbsp;</span><span>What counts?<br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span>Topics: P5js, javascript, the HTML(5) DOM, other languages, other workflows, other environments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>First Project</strong><span>: Set up a page using a version control system of your choice (github/gitlab/similar) AND a page to keep track of your coursework. You can use github pages, gitlab pages, or your own server. RIP </span><a href="http://people.ucsc.edu"><span>people.ucsc.edu</span></a><span>! No WYSIWYG platforms (wix, squarespace, neocities, carrd, cargo, etc.)</span></p>
<p><strong>Bonus project</strong><span>: Fork and do a pull request on the syllabus.</span><span><br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Week 2: </span><strong>Iteration</strong></h4>
<p><span>Topics: Working with the DOM, JS (re)fresher</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Project</strong> (due Apr 17): Pick a project that you&rsquo;ve already worked on. It can be something you&rsquo;ve done for Professor Gilette, Dr. Santos, Professor Moreno, or something you&rsquo;ve put together outside of a class. It should be something that you put down despite feeling like it could use more work. Spend the week iterating on this project. You don&rsquo;t need to finish it, but it's great if you do.</span></p>
<p><span>As you work, keep the following in mind (these will be discussion topics next week)</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What&rsquo;s it like working with code you wrote weeks or months or years ago?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What do you wish you&rsquo;d thought of when originally working on this project?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The changes you made; why? Was that aspect more familiar or unfamiliar?</span></li>

<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span>STUDENT HOURS FOR CLASS</span></p>
<p><span>Systemwide Senate Regulation 760 specifies that one academic credit corresponds to a total </span><span>of 30 hours of work for the median student over a quarter (e.g., 3 hours per week for a </span><span>10-week quarter). For this 5-unit course you can expect an average of roughly 15 hours of work each week, with some fluctuation. (Please see &ldquo;Grade Calculation&rdquo; for more detail.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK</span></p>
<p><span>Grades and feedback will be provided on your assignments through Canvas. At times we may meet synchronously via zoom to receive feedback. The Instructor and TA&nbsp; will provide direct comments and feedback on your assignments. Major assignments include a grading rubric that will be available to you prior to submitting your work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>STUDENT FEEDBACK</span></p>
<p><span>At the end of the quarter you will be asked to complete a Student Experience of Teaching</span></p>
<p><span>survey for this course. SETs provide an opportunity for you to give valuable feedback on</span></p>
<p><span>your learning that is honest and constructive. This anonymous feedback will help us</span></p>
<p><span>consider modifications to the course that will help future students learn more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span>GRADING POLICY</span></p>
<p><span>This course will focus on qualitative not quantitative assessment, something we&rsquo;ll discuss during the class, both with reference to your own work and the works we&rsquo;re studying. While you will get a final grade at the end of the term, neither the Teaching Assistant nor I will not be grading individual assignments, but rather asking questions and making comments that engage your work rather than simply evaluate it. You will also be reflecting carefully on your own work and the work of your peers. The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you&rsquo;re expected to. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>If this process causes more anxiety than it alleviates, see me at any point to confer about your progress in the course to date</strong>. If you are worried about your grade, your best strategy should be to show up, be involved, and do the assignments. <strong>You should consider this course a &ldquo;busy-work-free zone.&rdquo; If an assignment does not feel productive, we can find ways to modify, remix, or repurpose the instructions.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You will be doing a self-assessment at the midpoint of the quarter and a final reflection at the end that will include the grade you think you've earned according to the course rubric. While final grades are at the discretion of the TA and Instructor, I have found in most cases that students have a solid idea of their own performance. I have actually had to adjust more grades upwards than downwards.</span></p>
<p><span>Per university policy, letter grades are as follows: A - 90-100% / B - 80-89% / C - 70-79% / D - 60-69% / F - 0-59%</span></p>
<p><span>Assignments should be submitted by their due date to fulfill online discussion requirements. Late assignments may be accepted with approval from the instructor or TA.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</span></p>
<p><span>All members of the UCSC community benefit from an environment of trust, honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. You are expected to present your own work and acknowledge the work of others in order to preserve the integrity of scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span>Academic integrity in the arts requires transparency about your process in producing creative work, scholarship, and other responses to course materials and assignments. When any student makes false or misleading claims regarding their roles in authorship, participation, engagement, and other forms of work, they will be subject to the University&rsquo;s Academic Misconduct policies and procedures. All students should familiarize themselves with University policy on these topics, including information at &lt;</span><a href="https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html"><span>https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html</span></a><span>&gt;. When in doubt about the meaning and/or application of these policies in this course, students are responsible to seek answers via direct communication with the instructor. If you aren't sure, just ask!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
